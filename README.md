# Homework-3 
## Welcome To Sunithi's Personal Website
Hi! My name is Sunithi Krishnan, and I am a second-year studying Data Science and Finance at Northeastern University. 

For a little background on me, I was born and raised in the suburbs of Boston, and have lived in Massachusettes for my entire life. As a result, I love everything about the New England Area. I love all four seasons, as well as exploring everything that the area has to offer. For example, in the Summer, I love going to the beach with my friends and family, and in the Winter, I love going skiing. I am also a huge apple cider and hayride enthusiast in the Fall. Furthermore, I love watching Boston Sports especially the Boston Celtics and the New England Patriots.
